## Project Summary

This project marked the first time I had built a large scale React project.It involved studying and implementing Hooks, Function Components, UseContext, Auth0, UseReduce and Styled Components.
Quite the challenge it was and I for sure put blood, sweat and tears into it.
Hope you'll appreciate and enjoy it.
